# sqlalchemy-challenge
This is my submission for the module 10 challenge. My submission includes 2 files:
- climate_starter.ipynb - my jupyter notebook with analysis
- app.py - my climate app code

In climate_starter.ipynb, you can find:
- Precipitation Analysis - analyzing precipitation data from the last 12 months included in the database using a graph and summary statistics
- Station Analysis - analyzing station data to determine which station is the most active; calculating lowest, highest, and average temperatures from the most active station; and a graph of temperature observations made by the most active station

In app.py, you can find:
- Database Set Up
- Flask Set Up
- Flask Routes
I have also added error messages to the last 2 routes in the case of dates not included in the database
